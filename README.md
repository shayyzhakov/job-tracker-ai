# Job Tracker MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for tracking job interview processes using AI-powered chat interaction.
This service exposes structured tools (via MCP) that enable users to log, update, and query their ongoing job applications, interviews, contacts, and outcomes — all through natural language conversations with an LLM.

It supports:
• Structured event tracking (e.g. applications, interviews, offers)
• Company and role management
• Compensation and contact history
• Context-aware Q&A powered by AI

Designed to work seamlessly with LLMs like GPT Claude, and backed by Supabase for fast prototyping and persistent storage.
